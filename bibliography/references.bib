abstract = {This paper defines the 3D reconstruction problem as the process of reconstructing a 3D scene from numerous 2D visual images of that scene. It is well known that this problem is ill-posed, and numerous constraints and assumptions are used in 3D reconstruction algorithms in order to reduce the solution space. Unfortunately, most constraints only work in a certain range of situations and often constraints are built into the most fundamental methods (e.g. Area Based Matching assumes that all the pixels in the window belong to the same object). This paper presents a novel formulation of the 3D reconstruction problem, using a voxel framework and first order logic equations, which does not contain any additional constraints or assumptions. Solving this formulation for a set of input images gives all the possible solutions for that set, rather than picking a solution that is deemed most likely. Using this formulation, this paper studies the problem of uniqueness in 3D reconstruction and how the solution space cha...},

@article{Robinson2014,
abstract = {First, a meshless simulation method is presented for multiphase fluid–particle flows with a two-way coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) for the fluid and the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for the solid phase. The unresolved fluid model, based on the locally averaged Navier Stokes equations, is expected to be considerably faster than fully resolved models. Furthermore, in contrast to similar mesh-based Discrete Particle Models (DPMs), our purely particle-based method enjoys the flexibility that comes from the lack of a prescribed mesh. It is suitable for problems such as free surface flow or flow around complex, moving and/or intermeshed geometries and is applicable to both dilute and dense particle flows. Second, a comprehensive validation procedure for fluid–particle simulations is presented and applied here to the SPH–DEM method, using simulations of single and multiple particle sedimentation in a 3D fluid column and comparison with analytical models. Millimetre-sized particles are used along with three different test fluids: air, water and a water–glycerol solution. The velocity evolution for a single particle compares well (less than 1{\%} error) with the analytical solution as long as the fluid resolution is coarser than two times the particle diameter. Two more complex multiple particle sedimentation problems (sedimentation of a homogeneous porous block and an inhomogeneous Rayleigh Taylor Instability) are also reproduced well for porosities 0.6⩽∊⩽1.0, although care should be taken in the presence of high porosity gradients. Overall the SPH–DEM method successfully reproduces quantitatively the expected behaviour in these test cases, and promises to be a flexible and accurate tool for other, realistic fluid–particle system simulations (for which other problem-relevant test cases have to be added for validation).},

abstract = {Rapid disulfide bond formation and cleavage is an essential mechanism of life. Using large amplitude Fourier transformed alternating current voltammetry (FTacV) we have measured previously uncharacterized disulfide bond redox chemistry in Escherichia coli HypD. This protein is representative of a class of assembly proteins that play an essential role in the biosynthesis of the active site of [NiFe]-hydrogenases, a family of H2-activating enzymes. Compared to conventional electrochemical methods, the advantages of the FTacV technique are the high resolution of the faradaic signal in the higher order harmonics and the fact that a single electrochemical experiment contains all the data needed to estimate the (very fast) electron transfer rates (both rate constants ≥ 4000 s–1) and quantify the energetics of the cysteine disulfide redox-reaction (reversible potentials for both processes approximately −0.21 ± 0.01 V vs SHE at pH 6). Previously, deriving such data depended on an inefficient manual trial-and-erro...},

abstract = {This paper explores the effect of impeller design on the chaotic mixing in a helical ribbon mixer. Numerical simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method are used to solve for the fluid flow around the moving impellor. The mixing flow is visualised by extracting the hyperbolic Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) of the flow from the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field, which provides qualitative information about the topology of the mixing structures and highlights the major barriers to transport. This is combined with a mixing measure that calculates the degree of mixing between different regions. A single helical ribbon mixer (SHR) was found to create an axially symmetric circulation cell that moves fluid down the outside of the tank and upward near the centre. Smaller circulation cells near the inside edge of the ribbon superimpose a chaotic mixing flow over this primary flow, which stretches and folds fluid volumes around the ribbon according to the shape of the LCSs. The horizontal struts supporting the ribbon generate strong circumferential mixing, but this is only within a narrow horizontal plane with thickness comparable with the strut diameter. The addition of an extra ribbon, 180 degrees out of phase (DHR) doubles the number of smaller circulation cells while decreasing their efficiency in mixing the fluid between the inner and outer regions of the tank. Overall the mixing rate is improved over the other ribbon geometries. The addition of a central screw (CSR) creates a zone of low mixing immediately surrounding the screw. The mixing processes surrounding the helical ribbon are qualitatively identical to the SHR, but the overall mixing rate is slightly increased.},

@article{Robinson2014a,
abstract = {The Adaptive Two-Regime Method (ATRM) is developed for hybrid (multiscale) stochastic simulation of reaction-diffusion problems. It efficiently couples detailed Brownian dynamics simulations with coarser lattice-based models. The ATRM is a generalization of the previously developed Two-Regime Method [Flegg et al. , J. R. Soc., Interface9, 859 (2012)] to multiscale problems which require a dynamic selection of regions where detailed Brownian dynamics simulation is used. Typical applications include a front propagation or spatio-temporal oscillations. In this paper, the ATRM is used for an in-depth study of front propagation in a stochastic reaction-diffusion system which has its mean-field model given in terms of the Fisher equation [R. Fisher, Ann. Eugen.7, 355 (1937)]. It exhibits a travelling reaction front which is sensitive to stochastic fluctuations at the leading edge of the wavefront. Previous studies into stochastic effects on the Fisher wave propagation speed have focused on lattice-based models, but there has been limited progress using off-lattice (Brownian dynamics) models, which suffer due to their high computational cost, particularly at the high molecular numbers that are necessary to approach the Fisher mean-field model. By modelling only the wavefront itself with the off-lattice model, it is shown that the ATRM leads to the same Fisher wave results as purely off-lattice models, but at a fraction of the computational cost. The error analysis of the ATRM is also presented for a morphogen gradient model.},

abstract = {We study the dispersion of an initially packed, static granular bed by the injection of a liquid jet. This is a relevant system for many industrial applications, including paint dispersion or food powder dissolution. Both decompaction and dispersion of the powder are not fully understood, leading to inefficiencies in these processes. Here we consider a model problem where the liquid jet is injected below a granular bed contained in a cylindrical cell. Two different initial conditions are considered: a two-phase case where the bed is initially fully immersed in the liquid and a three-phase case where the bed and cell are completely dry preceding the injection of the liquid. The focus of this contribution is the simulation of these model problems using a two-way coupled SPH-DEM granularliquid method [M. Robinson, M. Ramaioli, and S. Luding, submitted (2013) and http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.0752 (2013)]. This is a purely particle-based method without any prescribed mesh, well suited for this and other problems involving a free (liquidgas) surface and a partly immersed particle phase. Our simulations show the effect of process parameters such as injection flow rate and injection diameter on the dispersion pattern, namely whether the granular bed is impregnated bottom-up or a jet is formed and compare well with experiments.},
